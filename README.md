# w2DjangoStudy
This is a simple Django app which is used to help me learn how to work with Django. I built it with referring website: https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/

Here is the address of the simple app: http://claude216.pythonanywhere.com/
I deployed it on pythonanywhere, and it will be on this platform till Late July.
Unfortunately, I haven't implement functions for multiple users, thus if you go the the website, you can only found my test posts.

Also, if you have any idea or suggestion, feel free to contact me and I will really appreaciate it!
